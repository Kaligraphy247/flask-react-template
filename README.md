# Flask + React
This is a template for running Flask + React from the same server (Python side) using
Flask's WSGI dev. server or production-grade servers like Gunicorn and Uvicorn.

Use this template if suits your needs, or not, it's up to you in the end.
More examples coming soon!

> This README is a work in progress.
